Basic Example Use Cases
-----------------------

**Requesting Historical Market Data**

To retrieve historical market data, you'll need to instantiate a historical data client with your API keys.
There are many different methods that allow you to access various stock and crypto data. To see the full range of
data types available, read the API reference for market data. In this example, we will query daily bar data for Apple Inc (AAPL)
between January 1st 2021 and December 31st 2021. Then we will convert the data to a dataframe and print it out to the console.

.. code-block:: python

    from alpaca.data.clients import HistoricalDataClient
    from alpaca.common.time import TimeFrame

    API_KEY = 'api-key'
    SECRET_KEY = 'secret-key'

    client = HistoricalDataClient(API_KEY, SECRET_KEY)

    bars = client.get_bars("AAPL", TimeFrame.Day, "2021-01-01", "2021-12-31")

    print(bars.df)

**Subscribing to Live Market Data**

Live market data is available for both crypto and stocks via websocket interfaces. Keep in mind live stock data is only available during market hours on trading days,
whereas live crypto data is available 24/7. In this example, we will subscribe to live quote data for Bitcoin (BTCUSD). To do so, first we will
need to create an instance of the CryptoDataStream client with our API keys. Then we can create an asynchronous callback method to handle
our live data as it is available.

.. code-block:: python

    from alpaca.data.stream_clients import CryptoDataStream

    API_KEY = 'api-key'
    SECRET_KEY = 'secret-key'

    client = CryptoDataStream(API_KEY, SECRET_KEY)

    # handler function will receive data as the data arrives
    async def handler(data):
        print(data)

    # subscribe to quote data for BTCUSD
    client.subscribe_quotes(handler, "BTCUSD")

    # start websocket client
    client.run()
